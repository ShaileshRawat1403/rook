Mobile access lets you connect to rook remotely from an iOS mobile device using secure tunneling.

:::warning Experimental Feature
Mobile access is a preview feature in active development. Behavior and configuration may change in future releases.

## How Mobile Access Works

Mobile access connects your iOS device to rook Desktop through a secure tunnel. After you install and configure the **rook AI** app, you can access rook from anywhere.

**Key details:**
- Uses [Lapstone](https://github.com/michaelneale/lapstone-tunnel), a public HTTPS tunnel service provided by Mic Neale
- Easy setup using a QR code with a unique secret key to secure the connection
- Your tunnel URL remains the same across sessions, so you only need to configure your mobile app once
- The connection requires your computer to be awake with rook Desktop running
- Automatically reconnects if interrupted and restarts when you launch rook Desktop

## Setup

### Install the App
1. Install the **rook AI** app on your iOS mobile device from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/goose-ai/id6752889295)

### Connect the App
